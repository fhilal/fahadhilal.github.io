# Academic Website Starter (Jekyll + Minimal Mistakes)

Sections included: **Publications, Talks, Teaching, News, CV**, plus a home page.

## Quick start
1. Create a repo named `yourusername.github.io` (public).
2. Upload these files (or extract the ZIP and push).
3. In **Settings → Pages**, set **Build and deployment** to **GitHub Actions**.
4. Edit `_config.yml`, `_data/navigation.yml`, and the content in `_pages/`, `_talks/`, `_teaching/`, `_news/`, `_bibliography/papers.bib`, and `files/cv.pdf`.
5. Commit to `main`—the site will deploy to `https://yourusername.github.io`.

> Tip: Mark selected publications in `papers.bib` with `keywords = {selected}` to show them on the home page.
